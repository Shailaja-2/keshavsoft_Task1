🏗️ How I Built This Project (Step-by-Step)
 
I started by setting up the basic folder structure and linking the Bootstrap 5 CDN so I wouldn't have to download heavy files.
First, I focused on the Home Page. I wanted a big "Hero" section that immediately tells users what the company does. I used a custom CSS gradient because I felt the standard Bootstrap colors were a bit too basic.
After that, I worked on the About Page. I spent time looking at the Bootstrap "Features" examples to see how they used icons and columns. I decided to use "Team Cards" with rounded images to make the agency feel more friendly and professional.
Finally, I built the Contact Page. I added a real form with validation. I even added a small JavaScript snippet so that when a user clicks "Submit," they get a "Thank You" alert instead of just a blank screen.

🤖 Tools & Snippets Used

Bootstrap Documentation: I used this the most, especially for figuring out the Grid system (row and col) and the Navbar classes.
AI (ChatGPT & Gemini): I used AI to help me write the custom CSS for the button hover effects and the linear gradient background. I also used Gemini to generate the custom images used in the hero and header sections to give the site a unique look.
Bootstrap Icons: I integrated the Bootstrap Icon library to give the cards a modern look.

🧗 Challenges I Faced

The biggest challenge was the Navbar. I wanted it to be sticky but also have a shadow that only showed up when scrolling. I also had some trouble getting the images in the "Meet the Team" section to be the exact same size. I fixed this by using object-fit: cover in my CSS, which made the images look uniform without stretching them.
Another small issue was the Form Validation. I had to research how Bootstrap’s needs-validation class worked with JavaScript to make sure the error messages appeared correctly.

📖 What I Learned

Through this task, I learned that you don’t need to write hundreds of lines of CSS to make a site look good. Bootstrap’s utility classes (like py-5, shadow-sm, and d-flex) save a lot of time. I also improved my skills in Remixing—taking a basic component from a library and changing its colors and spacing to make it look like a unique brand.
